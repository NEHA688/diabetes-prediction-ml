# 🧠 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project is a Machine Learning-based Diabetes Prediction System that predicts whether a person is diabetic or not using medical attributes like glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, age, etc.

The system analyzes patient health data and helps in early detection of diabetes using ML techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to:

- Analyze patient medical data
- Train a Machine Learning model
- Predict diabetes risk

This supports early diagnosis and preventive healthcare.
